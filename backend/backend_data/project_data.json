Similar to this website, it consists of a React.js frontend with a Flask backend that talks to a PostrgreSQL database. The purpose of the website was to provide users with a place where they could plan their future by searching for jobs, housing, and education within the same area. We got our data by scraping public APIs and then provided pages where users could sort and search through the data in our database for what they wished. I was the main backend and database programmer for the project, and while some of the deadlines were pretty grueling I ultimately learned a lot about web development from completing it.",

It's an on-rails shooter with an infinite, procedurally-generated leve (much like mobile infinite-runner games) that I made from scratch entirely by myself using the Godot engine. While it's complete for the sake of the class, I may return to it later to flesh out the mechanics and the level generation. It was a lot of fun to work on!",

Assuming the attacker already has root access to the machine, the script installs a backdoor as both a cron job and part of the root users’ .bashrc file, and then also creates a service that checks if those two backdoors still exist and reinstalls them if they don’t. Everything is trickily named to avoid detection. I got full credit for this and had a lot of fun writing and testing it! All on a virtual machine, of course.",

It’s more or less just a glorified text find-and-replace tool with file editing functions, but its been extremely useful!",
