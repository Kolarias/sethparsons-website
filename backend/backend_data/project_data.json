      "desc": "This project was my final assignment for my Game Technology class at UT. I made it as tribute to Star Fox 64, an absolute classic of a game that shaped my childhood in a big way. It's an on-rails shooter with an infinite, procedurally-generated level, much like mobile infinite-runner games. I made it from scratch entirely by myself using the Godot engine, and while it's complete for the sake of the class I may return to it later to flesh out the mechanics and the level generation. It was a lot of fun to work on!",
